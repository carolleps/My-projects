Your response goes here!
I've learned new HTML elements, such as <figure>. But I was expecting more. So far, it feels like a basic course, like free ones available. :(
Everything has been easy (not because I'm a genius, but because it was only the essentials.
It's been difficult to stay focused. I keep looking other stuff to do.
When I forget something (like "what is the tag for italic again??") I google it.
